# Chapter 2 -- The 50-Day Plan For Building A Personal Assistant Agentic System (PAAS)

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATIONS (Days 1-10)

### Day 9-10: Multi-Agent System Architecture & Tauri Foundation

These final days of the foundation phase focus on designing the overall architecture for your multi-agent system and establishing the Tauri/Rust foundation for your application. You'll explore how multiple specialized agents can work together to accomplish complex tasks that would be difficult for a single agent. You'll learn how Rust and Tauri can provide performance, security, and cross-platform capabilities that traditional web technologies cannot match. You'll establish the groundwork for a desktop application that can run intensive processing locally while still connecting to cloud services. You'll then apply these concepts to create a comprehensive architectural design for your PAAS that will guide the remainder of your development process.

- **Morning (3h)**: Learn multi-agent system design and Tauri basics
  - Agent communication protocols: Study different approaches for inter-agent communication, from simple API calls to more complex message-passing systems that enable asynchronous collaboration. Learn about serialization formats like MessagePack and Protocol Buffers that offer performance advantages over JSON when implemented in Rust, and explore how Tauri's IPC bridge can facilitate communication between frontend and backend components.
  - Task division strategies: Explore methods for dividing complex workflows among specialized agents, including functional decomposition and hierarchical organization. Learn how Rust's ownership model and concurrency features can enable safe parallel processing of tasks across multiple agents, and how Tauri facilitates splitting computation between a Rust backend and Svelte frontend.
  - System coordination patterns and Rust concurrency: Understand coordination patterns like supervisor-worker and peer-to-peer architectures that help multiple agents work together coherently. Study Rust's concurrency primitives including threads, channels, and async/await that provide safe parallelism for agent coordination, avoiding common bugs like race conditions and deadlocks that plague other concurrent systems.

- **Afternoon (3h)**: Design your PAAS architecture with Tauri integration
  - Define core components and interfaces: Identify the major components of your system including data collectors, processors, storage systems, reasoning agents, and user interfaces, defining clear boundaries between Rust and JavaScript/Svelte code. Create a modular architecture where performance-critical components are implemented in Rust while user-facing elements use Svelte for reactive UI updates.
  - Plan data flows and processing pipelines: Map out how information will flow through your system from initial collection to final summarization, identifying where Rust's performance advantages can be leveraged for data processing. Design asynchronous processing pipelines using Rust's async ecosystem (tokio or async-std) for efficient handling of I/O-bound operations like API requests and file processing.
  - Create architecture diagrams and set up Tauri project: Develop comprehensive visual representations of your system architecture showing both the agent coordination patterns and the Tauri application structure. Initialize a basic Tauri project with Svelte as the frontend framework, establishing project organization, build processes, and communication patterns between the Rust backend and Svelte frontend.
