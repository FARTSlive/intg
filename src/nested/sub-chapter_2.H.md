### Outsource Your Big Compute needs

Regardless of whether it is for your work [unless you work as a hdw admin in IT services and would benefit from a home lab], your ventures or side-hustles and any startup that you are contemplating. There are numerous reasons:

* Outsourcing compute needs instead of purchasing and managing hardware WILL save time, energy, and money

* This approach teaches extremely valuable and timely lessons about how economic ecosystems have evolve for today's needs.

* Helps you learn the principles. especially for computing needs. Default to service-based consumption until you can demonstrate with financial precision why ownership creates superior economic value. Only transition to ownership when you can articulate and show specific, quantifiable advantages that overcome the flexibility and scalability benefits of renting. The most successful organizations operate with this discipline rigorously -- the winners defer ownership until comprehensive understanding justifies the commitment; suckers and fools buy cheap, obsolete crap for more than it's worth to *save money.*
