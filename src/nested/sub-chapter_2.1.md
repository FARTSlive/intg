# Chapter 2 -- The 50-Day Plan For Building A Personal Assistant Agentic System (PAAS)

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATIONS (Days 1-10)

### Day 1-2: Understanding Agentic Systems & Large Language Models

During these first two days, you'll focus on building a comprehensive understanding of what makes agentic systems work, with particular emphasis on how LLMs can be used as their foundation. You'll explore how modern LLMs function, what capabilities they offer for creating autonomous agents, and what architectural patterns have proven most effective in research. You'll identify the key limitations you'll need to account for in your system design, such as context window constraints and hallucination tendencies. You'll study how to prompt LLMs effectively to get them to reason through complex tasks step-by-step. Finally, you'll explore how these concepts apply specifically to building intelligence gathering systems that can monitor and synthesize information from multiple sources.

- **Morning (3h)**: Study the fundamentals of agentic systems
  - LLM capabilities and limitations: Examine the core capabilities of LLMs like Claude and GPT-4, focusing on their reasoning abilities, knowledge limitations, and how context windows constrain what they can process at once. Study techniques like prompt engineering, chain-of-thought prompting, and retrieval augmentation that help overcome these limitations.
  - Agent architecture patterns (ReAct, Plan-and-Execute, Self-critique): Learn the standard patterns for building LLM-based agents, understanding how ReAct combines reasoning and action in a loop, how Plan-and-Execute separates planning from execution, and how self-critique mechanisms allow agents to improve their outputs. Focus on identifying which patterns will work best for continuous intelligence gathering and summarization tasks.
  - Key papers: Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, ReAct: Read these foundational papers to understand the research behind modern agent approaches, taking detailed notes on their methodologies and results. Implement simple examples of each approach using Python and an LLM API to solidify your understanding of how they work in practice.

- **Afternoon (3h)**: Set up development environment
  - Install necessary Python libraries (transformers, langchain, etc.): Set up a Python virtual environment and install the essential packages like LangChain, transformers, and relevant API clients you'll need throughout the project. Configure your API keys for LLM services you plan to use, ensuring your credentials are stored securely.
  - Set up cloud resources if needed: Determine whether you'll need cloud computing resources for more intensive tasks, considering options like AWS, GCP, or Azure for hosting your system. Create accounts, set up basic infrastructure, and ensure you can programmatically access any cloud services you'll require.
  - Create project structure and repository: Establish a well-organized GitHub repository with a clear structure for your codebase, including directories for each major component. Create a comprehensive README that outlines the project goals, setup instructions, and development roadmap.
