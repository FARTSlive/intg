# Chapter 2 -- The 50-Day Plan For Building A Personal Assistant Agentic System (PAAS)

The BIG REASON to build a PAAS is for radically improved intelligence gathering.

We do things like this to avoid being a mere spectator passively consuming content and to instead actively engage in intelligence gathering ... dogfooding the toolchain and workflow to accomplish this and learning how to do it is an example of what it means to stop being a spectator and actively engage in AI-assisted intelligence gathering.

## Preparation For The 50 Days

Review these BEFORE starting; develop your own plan for each

### [Milestones](nested/sub-chapter_2.A.md)

If you don't like the milestones, revise your course per your course with expectations that make sense for you.

### [Daily Workflow](nested/sub-chapter_2.B.md)

Develop your own daily workflow, the course is based on a 3-hr morning routine and a 3-hr afternoon routine, with the rest of your day devoted to homework and trying to keep up with the pace. If this does not work for you -- then revise your course per your course with expectations that make sense for you.

### [Autodidacticism](nested/sub-chapter_2.C.md)

Develop your own best practices, methods, approaches for your own autodidactic strategies, if you have not desire to become an autodidact, the course this kind of thing is clearly not for you or other low-agency people who require something resembling a classroom.

### [Communities](nested/sub-chapter_2.D.md)

Being an autodidact will assist you in developing your own best practices, methods, approaches for your own ways of engaging with 50-100 communities that matter. From a time management perspective, your will mostly need to be a hyperefficient lurker.

You can't fix most stupid comments or cluelessness, so be extremely careful about wading into discussions. Similarly, you should try not to be the stupid or clueless one. Please do not expect others to explain every little detail to you. Before you ask questions, you need to assure that you've done everything possible to become familiar with the vibe of the community, ie ***lurk first!!!*** AND it is also up to YOU to make yourself familiar with [pertinent papers](nested/sub-chapter_2.E.md), [relevant documentation](nested/sub-chapter_2.F.md), [trusted or classic technical references](nested/sub-chapter_2.G.md) and [everything about your current options are in the world of computational resources](nested/sub-chapter_2.H.md).

### [Papers](nested/sub-chapter_2.E.md)

READ more, improve your reading ability with automation and every trick you can think of ... but READ more and waste less time watching YouTube videos.

### [Documentation](nested/sub-chapter_2.F.md)

It's worth repeating for emphasis, READ more, improve your reading ability with automation and every trick you can think of ... but READ more and work on your reading ... so that you can stop wasting time watching YouTube videos.

### [References](nested/sub-chapter_2.G.md)

It's worth repeating for EXTRA emphasis, READ a LOT more, especially read technical references ... improve your reading ability with automation and every trick you can think of ... but READ more and stop wasting any time watching YouTube videos.

### [Big Compute](nested/sub-chapter_2.H.md)

You cannot possibly know enough about your options in terms of computational resources, but for Pete's sake, stop thinking that you need to have a monster honking AI workstation sitting on your desk. **BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE WITH RENTABLE BIG COMPUTE** and that includes observability, monitoring and trace activities to examine how well you are utilizing compute resources in near realtime.
